    <div id="cmat-nutritious-blog">
      <h2>This spinach omelet makes for ____ breakfast; it has the vegetables and protein needed for a healthy diet.</h2>
      <p>
        Correct Answer: <b>a nutritious</b><br><br>
         <b>Why “a nutritious” is the correct answer?</b><br><br>
         <b>The sentence:</b> <br>
         <b></b>This spinach omelet makes for ____ breakfast; it has the vegetables and protein needed for a healthy diet."<br><br>
         <b>The key clue here is:</b><br>
         It has the vegetables and protein needed for a healthy diet. <br><br>
         <b>Let’s break down the options:</b><br>
         <ul>
            <li><b>a delicious </b>– Focuses on taste, but doesn't relate to health.</li>
            <li><b>a filling </b>– Refers to quantity, not nutritional value.</li>
            <li><b>an edible</b> – Just means it's safe to eat, not ideal for describing a healthy breakfast.</li>
            <li><b>✅ a nutritious</b> – This is the perfect choice because it matches the idea of health, vegetables, and protein. The word nutritious means providing the nutrients your body needs to stay healthy and function well</li>
         </ul>

    </h2>
    <p>
      Correct Answer: <b>obsolete</b><br><br>

      <b>Why “obsolete” is the correct answer?</b><br><br>

      <b>The sentence:</b><br>
      “Jivan's grandfather's house is full of _____ technology such as rotary-dial phones and other devices that are no longer in use.”<br><br>

      <b>The key clue here is:</b><br>
      “Rotary-dial phones and other devices that are no longer in use.” This clearly refers to outdated or no longer used items.<br><br>

      <b>Let’s break down the options:</b><br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>prehistoric</b> – Refers to things from ancient human history, not just outdated devices.</li>
        <li><b>✅ obsolete</b> – This is the perfect choice. "Obsolete" means something that is outdated or no longer in use, just like rotary phones.</li>

        <li><b>advanced</b> – Refers to modern or cutting-edge technology, which doesn’t fit the sentence.</li>
      </ul>

  <div id="cmat-mischief-behavior">
    <h2>
      My younger brother constantly misbehaves and is always causing _____.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Correct Answer: <b>mischief</b><br><br>

      <b>Why “mischief” is the correct answer?</b><br><br>

      <b>The sentence:</b><br>
      “My younger brother constantly misbehaves and is always causing _____.”<br><br>

      <b>The key clue here is:</b><br>
      “Constantly misbehaves” clearly hints at playful or naughty troublemaking, often associated with children.<br><br>

      <b>Let’s break down the options:</b><br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>generosity</b> – This refers to kindness and giving, which doesn’t relate to misbehavior.</li>
        <li><b>violence</b> – This implies harmful or aggressive behavior, which is too extreme for “playful misbehavior.”</li>
        <li><b>courtesy</b> – This means politeness, the opposite of misbehaving.</li>
        <li><b>✅ mischief</b> – Perfect fit. Mischief means playful or minor troublemaking, often seen in children who are naughty but not harmful.</li>

  <h2>The teacher has found two students of her class to have ____ their assignment, so she is going to penalize them with lesser grades.</h2>
  <p>
    Correct Answer: <b>duplicated</b><br><br>

    <b>Why “duplicated” is the correct answer?</b><br><br>

    <b>The sentence:</b><br>
    “The teacher has found two students of her class to have ____ their assignment...”<br><br>

    <b>The key clue here is:</b><br>
    Two students submitted the same assignment, which means the content was repeated or copied.<br><br>

    <b>Let’s break down the options:</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>translated</b> – Changing language doesn't imply copying or cheating.</li>
      <li><b>multiplied</b> – Refers to mathematical operation, unrelated to assignments.</li>
      <li><b>✅ duplicated</b> – Best fit. Duplicated means copied exactly, which implies both students submitted the same work.</li>
      <li><b>plagiarized</b> – Although close, plagiarism usually refers to copying from external sources, not between students. “Duplicated” fits better for this internal scenario.</li>
    </ul>

<!--Question number 5-->
<div id="cmat-amend-policy-debate">
  <h2>The governor thinks the tax is a good one and would like to see it continue, but his opponent wants to ____ it.</h2>
  <p>
    Correct Answer: <b>amend</b><br><br>

    <b>Why “amend” is the correct answer?</b><br><br>

    <b>The sentence:</b><br>
    “The governor thinks the tax is a good one and would like to see it continue, but his opponent wants to ____ it.”<br><br>

    <b>The key clue here is:</b><br>
    The opponent doesn't aim to completely get rid of the tax, just change it.<br><br>

    <b>Let’s break down the options:</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>abolish</b> – Means to completely remove or eliminate. Too extreme if the context implies just adjusting the tax.</li>
      <li><b>✅ amend</b> – Best fit. To amend means to make changes or improvements without removing it entirely.</li>
      <li><b>modify</b> – Similar to amend, but “amend” is more appropriate in legal or policy contexts like taxes.</li>
      <li><b>enact</b> – Means to put a law or policy into action, not relevant when referring to changing an existing one.</li>

<div id="cmat-meaning-of-chide">
  <h2>Choose the best meaning of "Chide"</h2>

    Correct Answer: <b>criticize</b><br><br>

    <b>Why “criticize” is the correct answer?</b><br><br>

    <b>The word:</b><br>
    “Chide” is a verb commonly used to express disapproval or scold someone, especially in a mild or constructive way.<br><br>

    <b>The key clue here is:</b><br>
    Understanding the tone — it doesn’t mean extreme punishment, but a verbal correction or reproach.<br><br>

    <b>Let’s break down the options:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>compliment</b> – This is the opposite of chide. Compliment means praise.</li>
      <li><b>reward</b> – Rewarding is giving a positive benefit, not correction.</li>
      <li><b>punish</b> – While close, punishment usually implies a consequence or penalty, not just verbal feedback.</li>
      <li><b>✅ criticize</b> – This is the most accurate meaning. To chide someone is to criticize or scold them for wrongdoing.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Choose the best meaning of "Boisterous"</h2>

    <b>Let’s break down the options:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>nervous</b> – Refers to being anxious or uneasy, not loud or energetic.</li>
      <li><b>✅ noisy</b> – Best matches the idea of being loud and energetic, the core meaning of “boisterous.”</li>
      <li><b>organized</b> – Implies order and structure, which is the opposite of being boisterous.</li>
      <li><b>quiet</b> – Directly contradicts the meaning of boisterous.</li>

    “Benevolent” describes someone who is kind-hearted, generous, and has a desire to help others.<br><br>

    <ul>
      <li><b>cruel</b> – Means intentionally causing pain or suffering, the opposite of benevolent.</li>

      <li><b>unlikely</b> – Means not likely to happen, which is opposite to imminent.</li>
      <li><b>distant</b> – Refers to something far away in time or space, unlike imminent.</li>

  <h2>Choose the correct alternative which improves the sentence:</h2>
  <p>
    One of the main reasons for elephant poaching <u>are the profits received from selling the ivory tusks</u>.<br><br>

    Correct Answer: <b>is the profits received from selling the ivory tusks</b><br><br>

    <b>Why “is the profits received from selling the ivory tusks” is the correct answer?</b><br><br>

    <b>The grammar rule:</b><br>
    The subject of the sentence is “One of the main reasons,” which is singular. Therefore, the verb must also be singular.<br><br>

    <b>The key clue here is:</b><br>
    Even though “profits” is plural, the subject “One” requires a singular verb.<br><br>

    <b>Let’s break down the options:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>✅ is the profits received from selling the ivory tusks</b> – Correct subject-verb agreement.</li>
      <li><b>have the profits received from selling the ivory tusks</b> – Incorrect verb form for singular subject.</li>
      <li><b>have been receiving from selling the ivory tusks</b> – Incorrect tense and agreement.</li>

    <u>Neither cats nor a dog was killed by the tiger</u> that entered the village yesterday.<br><br>

    Correct Answer: <b>No change is necessary</b><br><br>

    <b>Why “No change is necessary” is the correct answer?</b><br><br>

    <b>The grammar rule:</b><br>
    In “neither...nor” constructions, the verb agrees with the subject closest to it.<br><br>

    <b>The key clue here is:</b><br>
    Since “a dog” is singular, the singular verb “was” is correct.<br><br>

    <b>Let’s break down the options:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Neither cats nor a dog were killed by the tiger</b> – Incorrect, verb should be singular.</li>

<div id="cmat-grammar-i-wish-arrive-late">
  <h2>Choose the correct alternative to improve the sentence:</h2>
  <p>
    I wish <u>you couldn't arrive so late all the time</u>.<br><br>

    <b>Correct Answer:</b> <b>you wouldn't arrive so late all the time</b><br><br>

    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    When you talk about wishing someone would change a repeated or habitual behavior, like arriving late often, you use <i>“wouldn’t”</i>. This expresses a desire for them to stop doing something.<br><br>

    Saying <i>“couldn’t”</i> suggests that the person is unable to arrive late, which doesn’t really make sense here because arriving late is an action they choose to do.<br><br>

    So, <i>“I wish you wouldn’t arrive so late all the time”</i> means you want them to stop being late regularly.<br><br>

    <b>Why the other options don’t work:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>“You should have arrive so late all the time”</b> – This is grammatically incorrect and also changes the meaning completely.</li>
      <li><b>“You must not have arrived so late all the time”</b> – This is awkward and doesn’t express a wish.</li>
      <li><b>No change is necessary</b> – The original sentence is incorrect, so change is needed.</li>

<div id="cmat-conditional-water-resources">
  <h2>Choose the correct alternative to improve the sentence:</h2>
  <p>
    If Nepal had the necessary expertise on water resources, <u>the country should be producing electricity in a huge amount</u>.<br><br>

    <b>Correct Answer:</b> <b>the country would produce electricity in a huge amount</b><br><br>

    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    This sentence talks about a hypothetical situation — something that isn’t true right now but could be imagined.<br><br>

    For these “if” sentences (called second conditional), the pattern is:<br>
    <i>If + past tense, ... would + base verb</i>.<br><br>

    So, instead of saying “should be producing,” which sounds awkward here, we say “would produce” to show the imagined result.<br><br>

    Put simply, it means: “If Nepal had the skills, then it would produce a lot of electricity.”<br><br>

    <b>Why the other options don’t work:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>the country will produce electricity in a huge amount</b> – “Will” is for real future events, not hypothetical ones.</li>
      <li><b>the country is producing electricity in a huge amount</b> – Present tense doesn’t fit the hypothetical “if” clause.</li>
      <li><b>No change is necessary</b> – The original sentence’s verb phrase doesn’t match the conditional grammar.</li>

<div id="cmat-adjective-order-cup-saucer">
  <h2>Choose the correct alternative to improve the sentence:</h2>
  <p>
    My father brought home <u>a little, old, amazing, Nepalese cup and saucer</u>.<br><br>

    <b>Correct Answer:</b> <b>an amazing, little, old, Nepalese cup and saucer</b><br><br>

    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    When you use multiple adjectives before a noun in English, they usually follow a specific order:<br>
    <i>Opinion → Size → Age → Origin → Noun</i>.<br><br>

    In this sentence:<br>
    - “amazing” is an opinion,<br>
    - “little” describes size,<br>
    - “old” tells age,<br>
    - “Nepalese” shows origin.<br><br>

    So, the correct order is: <i>an amazing, little, old, Nepalese cup and saucer</i>.<br><br>

    Also, since “amazing” starts with a vowel sound, use “an” instead of “a.”<br><br>

    <b>Why the other options don’t work:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>a little, old, amazing, Nepalese cup and saucer</b> – Wrong adjective order and article.</li>
      <li><b>a Nepalese old, amazing and little cup and saucer</b> – Incorrect adjective order and article.</li>

<div id="cmat-place-value-5629">
  <h2>In 5629, which digit is in the hundred place?</h2>
  <p>
    Correct Answer: <b>6</b><br><br>

    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    The number 5629 can be broken down by place value:<br>
    - The digit 5 is in the thousands place,<br>
    - The digit 6 is in the hundreds place,<br>
    - The digit 2 is in the tens place,<br>

<div id="cmat-work-completion-days">
  <h2>If 12 persons can complete a work in 4 days, in how many days can 4 persons complete the work?</h2>
  <p>
    Correct Answer: <b>12</b><br><br>

    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    The total amount of work stays the same, no matter how many people are working.<br><br>

    First, calculate the total work in person-days:<br>
    12 persons × 4 days = 48 person-days.<br><br>

    Now, if 4 persons are working, divide total work by number of persons to find the days needed:<br>
    48 person-days ÷ 4 persons = 12 days.<br><br>

    So, 4 persons will take <b>12 days</b> to finish the work.<br><br>

    This is a classic example of work and time problems where the product of workers and days is constant.

<div id="cmat-real-roots-equation">
  <h2>Equation of (x + 1)<sup>2</sup> - x<sup>2</sup> = 0 has number of real roots equal to....</h2>
  <p>
    Correct Answer: <b>1</b><br><br>

    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    Let’s start by expanding the equation:<br>
    (x + 1)<sup>2</sup> - x<sup>2</sup> = (x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 1) - x<sup>2</sup> = 2x + 1.<br><br>

    Now, set this equal to zero:<br>
    2x + 1 = 0.<br><br>

    Solving for x:<br>
    2x = -1 → x = -1/2.<br><br>

    There is only one value of x that satisfies the equation, so the number of real roots is <b>1</b>.<br><br>

    Correct Answer: <b>1</b><br><br>

    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
    We are given the sum:<br>
    a + (a + 4) + (a + 5) = 12.<br><br>

    Combine like terms:<br>
    a + a + 4 + a + 5 = 12 → 3a + 9 = 12.<br><br>

    Subtract 9 from both sides:<br>
    3a = 12 - 9 → 3a = 3.<br><br>

    Divide both sides by 3:<br>
    a = 3 ÷ 3 → a = 1.<br><br>

    <li>Phulmaya is 20 years old</li>
  </ol>
  Correct Answer: <b>Dibya is 20 years old</b><br><br>
  <b>Explanation</b><br>
<b>Given</b><br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Age range:</b> youngest is 17, eldest &#40;Ekta&#41; is 22</li>
  <li>All birthdays are on the same date, so no one shares the same age</li>
  <li>People: Anita, Bhagawatee, Chandra, Dibya, Ekta, Phulmaya → 6 people, 6 different ages: 17 to 22</li>
</ul>
<b>Clues:</b>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Ekta is eldest → 22</li>
  <li>Youngest's age is 17</li>
  <li>Phulmaya is somewhere between Bhagawatee and Dibya
  <ul>
    <li>So: either Bhagawatee &gt; Phulmaya &gt; Dibya or Bhagawatee &lt; Phulmaya &lt; Dibya</li>

  <li>Anita is elder than Bhagawatee
    <ul>
      <li>Anita &gt; Bhagawatee</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Chandra is older than Dibya 
    <ul>
      <li>Chandra &gt; Dibya</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<b>Try assigning relative positions &#40;not exact ages yet&#41;:</b><br>
Let’s attempt to construct a possible order using logic: <br>
<b>Step 1: Fix extremes</b>
<ul>
  <li>Ekta = 22</li>
  <li>Youngest = 17 &rarr; we don’t know who yet</li>
</ul>
<b>Step 2: Use relational clues</b><br>
Start placing based on relationships:
<ul>
  <li>From clue 4: Anita &gt; Bhagawatee</li>
  <li>From clue 3: Phulmaya is between Bhagawatee and Dibya</li>
  <li>From clue 5: Chandra &gt; Dibya</li>
</ul>
Let’s try this order (example): 
<ol type="1">
  <li>Ekta – 22</li>
  <li>Anita – 21</li>
  <li>Bhagawatee – 20</li>
  <li>Phulmaya – 19</li>
  <li>Dibya – 18</li>
  <li>Chandra – 17 &larr; Not possible! Chandra is older than Dibya</li>
</ol>
&rarr; Let's fix that <br>
Try again: 
<ol type="1">
  <li>Ekta – 22</li>
  <li>Anita – 21</li>
  <li>Chandra – 20</li>
  <li>Bhagawatee – 19</li>
  <li>Phulmaya – 18</li>
  <li>Dibya – 17</li>
</ol>
Now test the conditions:
<ul>
  <li>Chandra &gt; Dibya</li>
  <li>Anita &gt; Bhagawatee</li>
  <li>Phulmaya between Bhagawatee &#40;19&#41; and Dibya &#40;17&#41; &rarr; yes</li>
  <li>Ekta is eldest</li>
  <li>Youngest = Dibya = 17</li>
</ul>
Perfect <br>
<b>Now test each option:</b>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Dibya is 20 years old <br>
      &rarr; In our valid order, Dibya = 17 → So Dibya can't be 20 <br>

  </li>
  <li>Phulmaya is 18 years old <br>

  <b>Explanation</b><br>
  <b>Given:</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li>There are 6 cousin sisters: Anita, Bhagawatee, Chandra, Dibya, Ekta, Phulmaya</li>
    <li>All ages are unique between 17 &#40;youngest&#41; and 22 &#40;eldest&#41;</li>

  </ol>
   Correct Answer: <b>Bhagawatee is 17 years old</b><br><br>
  <b>Explanation</b><br>
  <b>Given:</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li>There are 6 cousin sisters: Anita, Bhagawatee, Chandra, Dibya, Ekta, Phulmaya</li>
    <li>Ages are all different, from 17 (youngest) to 22 (eldest)</li>

  <b>Analysis:</b><br>
  For two cousins to be between Chandra and Phulmaya, the age gap between them must be at least 3 years (e.g., 18, 19, 20 between them). This tells us the relative order but not exact ages.<br><br>

Phulmaya is somewhere between Bhagawatee and Dibya in age, Anita is elder to Bhagawatee and Chandra is older than Dibya.

  <b>If Anita is one year elder to Chandra, the number of logically possible orders of all six cousin sisters by increasing age is:</b>

    <li>2</li>
    <li><b>3</b></li>
    <li>4</li>
    <li>5</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  Correct Answer: <b>3</b><br><br>
  <b>Explanation</b><br>
  <b>Given:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Youngest is 17 years old</li>
    <li>Ekta is the eldest → 22 years old</li>
    <li>Phulmaya is between Bhagawatee and Dibya</li>
    <li>Anita is elder than Bhagawatee</li>
    <li>Chandra is older than Dibya</li>
    <li>Anita is 1 year older than Chandra</li>
  </ul>

  Let’s define the 6 people to place in increasing age order, while respecting the constraints.

  We must consider:
  <ul>
    <li>Ekta = 22 (fixed)</li>
    <li>Youngest = 17 → Only 1 person can be 17</li>
    <li>All ages different → So remaining ages are: 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22</li>
    <li>Anita = Chandra + 1 (gap of exactly 1)</li>
    <li>Chandra > Dibya</li>
    <li>Anita > Bhagawatee</li>
    <li>Phulmaya is between Bhagawatee and Dibya</li>
  </ul>

  Trying all combinations that satisfy all constraints gives 3 valid age orders.

  Hence, <b>number of logically possible orders = 3</b>.

  Correct Answer: <b>Bhagawatee is 18 years old and Anita is 20 years old</b><br><br>

  <b>Explanation</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Total 6 cousin sisters: Anita, Bhagawatee, Chandra, Dibya, Ekta, Phulmaya</li>
    <li>All ages are different between 17 (youngest) and 22 (eldest)</li>

        <li>Bhagawatee = 18</li>
        <li>Dibya = 17</li>

        <li>Bhagawatee = 18, Phulmaya = 17, Dibya = 19 → invalid since Chandra = 19 and must be older than Dibya</li>
        <li>So best valid match:
